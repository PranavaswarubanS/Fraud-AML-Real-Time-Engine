This is an one stop Transaction, Event, and User real-time engine designed to help companies detect money laundering, service abuse or fraud behavior.

We provide an easy-to-use rule builder that can leverage any type of data, an engine capable of running checks in batch or in real-time, and a case manager to improve operational efficiency.

Marble is beneficial for payment service providers (PSPs), banking-as-a-service (BaaS) providers, neo banks, marketplaces, telecommunications companies... It allows them to quickly set up and update detection scenarios that generate decisions within minutes.

These decisions can trigger events in your systems, introduce friction, or restrict operations in real-time. They can also be investigated within Marble using our case manager or in your own system by utilizing our API.

This is developed with compliance requirements in mind, ensuring that everything is versioned and auditable without any time limitations.

#### About Enterprise features

The core of the decision engine is available in open-source, but some advanced features are only accessible with a lincense. As long as you are running it locally with a test setup (using the Firebase auth emulator for end user authentication), you will see all the features, but you will be restricted if you authenticate with a real Firebase auth app.

### 💭 **Example Use Cases**

---

Our incredible flexibility is due to its fully open data model. Here are some applications already in use :

- Transaction monitoring for financial institutions (AML & fraud), supporting every type of payment scheme (including the exotic ones: Marble handles any type of data).
- User/account monitoring.
- User risk score calculation at onboarding and throughout their lifecycle.
- Event scoring: adding new beneficiaries, subscribing to new products, etc.
- Vendor/buyer checks for marketplaces: return abuse, fake transactions, etc.
- Condition abuse: robocalling for telecom companies, bot management on social networks and apps.
- Embedded in financial SaaS: fine control of expenses for end users.

Feel free to try other use cases and let us know! We'd love to hear from you.
